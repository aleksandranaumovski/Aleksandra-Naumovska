          <h2>Highlights of my travels</h2>
          <p>As you can see on the picture I love doing new stuff.This picture is taken early on the morning on the hill Ljuboten,after all night hiking.
          I love to challenge myself to do something that never crossed my mind till that exact moment. About this picture and that experience I will tell that made me want to go hiking at least 3 times a month and spend more time for me.In this picture i am freezing cold and have more than 4 items to keep me warm.</p>

          <p>When I heard of trip to Poland I instantly thought of snow.We were in Zakopane,which is a mountain place.There is the famous upside-down house which now is museum.At that period was closed so we didn't went in.</p>
